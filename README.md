# Dylan's Stack-based Language (DSL)

## Description

Dylan's Stack-based Language. A small toy language I decided to make. I'd like it to be fully featured enough to compile itself

It will, naturally, be stack-based. It will also ideally be esoteric and annoying to use.

My inspiration was the esolang "Emoji." It made me want to make a stack based language is all.

## Features

There are several features I plan to implement

[ ] - pointers/references

[ ] - c structs

[ ] - simple stack manipulation

[ ] - low level access/bindings to assembly or C or something

[ ] - modules

[ ] - boolean types

[ ] - casts

## Build system

Just run `make`
